# Regression Project for Marketing Outcome Prediction

## Project Overview

Most companies invest in various marketing mediums such as television advertisements, social media and influencers, and radio promotions to attract customers and advertise products. With the advent of digital marketing and the ubiquitous availability of information, data analysis is becoming increasingly important.

### Objective

In this project, we will use the advertising and sales dataset available on Kaggle to predict the sales resulting from expenditure towards various marketing mediums. By leveraging regression techniques, we aim to:

1. Predict sales based on different marketing expenditures.
2. Draw insights on which marketing mediums have the highest impact on sales.
3. Implement cross-validation to avoid overfitting and underfitting.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that influence sales.
4. **Model Training**: Train a regression model to predict sales based on marketing expenditures.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.
6. **Insights and Interpretation**: Analyze the results to determine which marketing mediums have the highest impact on sales.
7. **Model Deployment**: FastAPI

## Tools and Libraries
